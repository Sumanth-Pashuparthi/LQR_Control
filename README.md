# Quadrator_LQR_Implementation
The objective of the project is to design a controller for a quadrotor that monitors a restricted airspace. If an unidentified Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) enters the airspace, the quadrotor needs to launch from the nest, follow and capture the UAV and return to the nest.
